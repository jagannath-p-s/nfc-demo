# 🏷️ whitetap demo app

This test web application is designed for a client to consolidate all his social links in one place like Linktree. Even though this is such a simple application, it has high potential. Once the coding is done, the client can then host it and write the URL to a MIFARE Classic NFC card. Then all his social links can be shared with just a tap on NFC-enabled devices.
